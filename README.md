# AlgorithmsVisualizerJS
https://nilusche.github.io/AlgorithmsVisualizerJS/ <br>
This is an algorithms and datastructures project to visualize sorting algorithms. <br>
The purpose of this project was to learn javascript by using it in an already familiar field. <br>
For me that field was algorithms. <br>

As of now only sorting algorithms are visualized.<br>
Visualization of other algortithms like graph-algorithms will likely follow. <br>
