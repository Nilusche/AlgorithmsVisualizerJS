This is an Algorithms-and-datastructures-project to visualize sorting algorithms. <br>
The purpose of this project was to learn javascript with a project-based approach by combining it with an already familiar topic of mine. <br>
For me that topic was algorithms. <br>

As of now only sorting algorithms are visualized.<br>
Visualization of other algortithms like graph-algorithms will likely follow. <br>

This project has been created within my journey to learn javascript frameworks like Vuejs. <br>
